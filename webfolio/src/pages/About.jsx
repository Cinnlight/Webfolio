            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio! I enjoy many aspects of development, but databases and server-sided programming are my favorite. I spent 6 months studying with 
                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Oden Project</a>, and another 6 months with a university hosted bootcamp for full-stack development.

            <p>
                I've been an avid gamer and computer enthusiast since I was a child. I've worked in the medical field for 10 years as a phlebotomist, assisting patients and doctors alike. I'm now transitioning into programming, fulfilling a life-long dream of following a career in technology.
